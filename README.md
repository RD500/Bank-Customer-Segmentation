## Abstract

The project employs **clustering techniques** such as K-Means to analyze customer data, including transaction patterns, account history, and demographics. This segmentation enables improved customer targeting and service optimization.

---

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is critical in understanding and catering to diverse customer needs. Banks can utilize this to:

- Enhance customer service.
- Optimize marketing campaigns.
- Tailor products and services to specific groups.

The project implements **K-Means Clustering** for grouping customers based on parameters like demographics, spending habits, and account balance.

## Dataset Description

- **Size**: Over 1 million transactions by 800,000+ customers.  
- **Features**:
  - Customer demographics (age, gender, location).
  - Account balance.
  - Transaction details (amount, type).

### Objectives:
1. Perform clustering to identify customer groups.
2. Analyze regional patterns.
3. Conduct transaction-related studies for service optimization.

## Implementation

### Tools and Libraries

- **NumPy**: Array operations and linear algebra.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.  
- **Scikit-Learn**: Clustering algorithms.

### Clustering Methodology

1. **Demographic Segmentation**  
   - Based on customer age and account balance.

2. **Behavioral Segmentation**  
   - Transaction amount vs. account balance.

3. **Geographic Segmentation**  
   - Location vs. account balance.

### Code and Results

- **Elbow Method**: Determining optimal clusters.  
- **K-Means Algorithm**: Segmentation across various dimensions.

#### Results:

- **Demographic Segmentation:**
  - Ages 20â€“25 contribute less to clusters; working-class customers are the main targets.

- **Behavioral Segmentation:**
  - Customers with high transaction amounts and account balances are key targets.

- **Geographic Segmentation:**
  - Locations with high account balances are identified for expansion.

## Conclusion

Effective clustering allows banks to:

1. Identify high-value customers.
2. Enhance service personalization.
3. Make informed decisions regarding new services and resource allocation.

Future work involves refining clustering methods and experimenting with real-world workload data.
